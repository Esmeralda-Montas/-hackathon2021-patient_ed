p# 2021-Hackathon: Patient Ed
Most have us have had an encounter with a medical professional and have not understood at least one or two things. 
This project aims to help patients understand their medical information a bit more by providing educational snippets 
through a parsed medical record.

# Goals of the Project:
The expectation of this project is to implement the following features:<br />

[1] Parse through patient record after primary care visit and present it in an intuitive and streamlined way
where educational 'snippets' would be shown

[2] Parse Doctor Instructions and set notification remainders to patients for prescriptions

[3] Provide an calendar where patients could track symptoms and provide a check-up prep portal where patients are given
recommended questions to ask a physicans and also provide a summary of symptons that they want to bring up to physicians.
